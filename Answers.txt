In my testing I found a consistent pattern of the GoF_Fixed Singleton normally being the fastest by significant margins.
This was generally followed by Boost, C++ 11 and C++ 0x being the slowest of the 4. The reason why C++ 0x is significantly slower than the others is due to its design.
Although it is thread safe it comes at a cost. It may stop threads until the initial thread that requested the instance completes its task. Once it 
completes, the remaining threads will continue and all instances will point to this created one. This can be heavy on resources.

C++ 11 (static) implementation is good and is thread-safe on any compiler that supports the C++ 11 threading model.
It is shorter and simpler but it is impossible to make it portably thread-safe for pre C++ 11 compilers.
It uses lazy instantiation, properly destructs itself and doesn't use any mutexes or atomics. This is my preferred method
however that would only apply for post C++ 11 compilers. If I had to pick one regarding pre C++ 11, I would choose Boost.
It is thread-safe by using a double lock and is fast.
